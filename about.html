    <h1>About Genshin Impact Wish Tracker</h1>
    <h2>
      This web application was originally designed for personal use to help me
      log my savings for characters and signature weapons in the game Genshin
      Impact. I wanted a tool that allows me to visualize my progress and track
      the number of wishes I'm saving. In the near future, I plan to add an
      estimator that pulls data from the Genshin Impact API. This feature will
      enable users to log various ways they may obtain Fates/Primogems (such as
      BP, Welkin, Commissions, Quests, Spiral Abyss, etc.) and receive an
      estimated timeframe for reaching their wish goals based on the timing and
      duration of character banners.

    <h2>
      My aim is to make the application as customizable as possible! If you have
      any suggestions for improvement or feedback regarding user experience,
      user interface, or anything else you would like to see, please don't
      hesitate to reach out to me via email at
      <a href="mailto:nadiavespalec00@gmail.com">nadiavespalec00@gmail.com</a>.
